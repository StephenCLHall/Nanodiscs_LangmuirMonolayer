### Software Requirements
Data was analysed using RasCAL 2014 beta, freely available at <https://sourceforge.net/projects/rscl/>  
No modifications were made to the underlying RasCAL code.

RasCAL runs within a Matlab 2015b environment.  
Similarly, all custom code here was written and executed within Matlab 2015b.  
  
In this repository, we have included all necessary files and custom code, which in conjunction with RasCAL 2014 beta and Matlab 2015b will be able to reproduce all analysis presented
in article cited above. Code which processes the Bayesian output file from RasCAL will frequently utilise functions included in RasCAL, so it is reccommended that RasCAL is preloaded in memory in advance.
  
### Raw Data  

All reflectometry data can be obtained from the ILL data Archive

Lipid-polymer interaction DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.5291/ILL-DATA.9-12-458>  
Lipid-Nanodisc interaction DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.5291/ILL-DATA.9-12-457>  

### Datasets  

Here, we have deposited five directories, each containing all data and analysis required to replicate the analysis performed in the cited article.  
All data files are saved as `.txt` files, with comma separated values as Q, Reflectivity, Error.

Directory | Description
--------- | -----------
PC_dRAFT_SMA	| All data and analysis scripts corresponding to the interaction of DMPC Langmuir monlayers with deuterated RAFT-SMA
PC_PG_dRAFT_SMA | All data and analysis scripts corresponding to the interaction of 8:2 DMPC:DMPG Langmuir monlayers with deuterated RAFT-SMA
PC_SMALP_Nanodiscs | All data and analysis scripts corresponding to the interaction of DMPC Langmuir monlayers with DMPC SMALP Nanodiscs
PC_SMILP_Nanodiscs | All data and analysis scripts corresponding to the interaction of DMPC Langmuir monlayers with DMPC SMILP Nanodiscs
PC_RAFT-SMALP_Nanodiscs | All data and analysis scripts corresponding to the interaction of DMPC Langmuir monlayers with DMPC RAFT-SMALP Nanodiscs

### Data, models and analysis  

Each directory contains:

File | Description
---- | -----------
dataFiles | A directory containing all experimental data files required to replicate our analysis.
`Fit.mat` | A RasCAL project file containing experimental and fitting parameters.
`Model.m` | A custom layer model, preloaded into Fit.mat.
`BAYES.mat` | Bayesian MCMC analysis output as generated by RasCALs inbuilt Bayesian analysis routines
`ReflectivityPlot.m` | A script to plot reflectivity profiles, best fits and confidence intervals as determined by MCMC analysis. Data can be plotted as either R vs Q or RQ^4 vs Q, with loglog or semilog scales.
`SLDplot.m` | A script to plot SLD profile best fit and 95% confidence intervals as determined by MCMC analysis.
`VolumeFractionPlot_Pristine.m` | A script to convert fitted SLD profiles to volume fraction profiles for initial pristine phospholipid monolayers.
`VolumeFractionPlot_Final.m` | A script to convert fitted SLD profiles to volume fraction profiles for phospholipid monolayers after interactions.
`CorrelationPlot.m` | A script to generate correlation plots of all fitted parameters from MCMC chains.
`CalcConfidenceIntervals.m` | A script to calculate mean and confidence intervals associated with parameters extrapolated from fitted parameters.
