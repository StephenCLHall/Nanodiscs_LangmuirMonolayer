We have included all necessary files and custom code, which in conjunction with RasCAL 2014 beta and Matlab 2015b will be able to reproduce all analysis presented
in article cited above

Data was analysed using RasCAL 2014 beta, freely available at <https://sourceforge.net/projects/rscl/>
No modifications were made to the underlying RasCAL code.

RasCAL runs within a Matlab 2015b environment.
Similarly, all custom code here was written and executed within Matlab 2015b.

Here, we have deposited five directories:

* PC_dRAFT_SMA				      	:	All data and analysis scripts corresponding to the interaction of DMPC Langmuir monlayers with deuterated RAFT-SMA
* PC_PG_dRAFT_SMA			      	:	All data and analysis scripts corresponding to the interaction of 8:2 DMPC:DMPG Langmuir monlayers with deuterated RAFT-SMA
* PC_SMALP_Nanodiscs	      	:	All data and analysis scripts corresponding to the interaction of DMPC Langmuir monlayers with DMPC SMALP Nanodiscs
* PC_SMILP_Nanodiscs	      	:	All data and analysis scripts corresponding to the interaction of DMPC Langmuir monlayers with DMPC SMILP Nanodiscs
* PC_RAFT-SMALP_Nanodiscs			:	All data and analysis scripts corresponding to the interaction of DMPC Langmuir monlayers with DMPC RAFT-SMALP Nanodiscs

Each directory contains:

* dataFiles					      	    :	A directory containing all experimental data files required to replicate our analysis.
* Fit.mat						      	    :	A RasCAL project file containing experimental and fitting parameters.
* Model.m						      	    :	A custom layer model, preloaded into Fit.mat.
* BAYES.mat						          :	Bayesian MCMC analysis output as generated by RasCALs inbuilt Bayesian analysis routines
* ReflectivityPlot.m				    :	A script to plot reflectivity profiles, best fits and confidence intervals as determined by MCMC analysis.
									                Data can be plotted as either R vs Q or RQ^4 vs Q, with loglog or semilog scales.
* SLDplot.m						          :	A script to plot SLD profile best fit and 95% confidence intervals as determined by MCMC analysis.
* VolumeFractionPlot_Pristine.m	:	A script to convert fitted SLD profiles to volume fraction profiles for initial pristine phospholipid monolayers.
* VolumeFractionPlot_Final.m		:	A script to convert fitted SLD profiles to volume fraction profiles for phospholipid monolayers after interactions.
* CorrelationPlot.m				      :	A script to generate correlation plots of all fitted parameters from MCMC chains.
* CalcConfidenceIntervals.m		  :	A script to calculate mean and confidence intervals associated with parameters extrapolated from fitted parameters.
